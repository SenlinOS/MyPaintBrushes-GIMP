# Update:

**2025-03-18 ➤‍‍**

- Because it has no effect in GIMP3, the default parameters of 028_Blend and 029_Smear changed (also applicable to GIMP2.10.x)

- Improved icons for 033_Grass and 036_Plush.

2020-03-02

- Remove the smudge effect of the [016_Flat-Brush], because the smudge effect will fade the color of the initial position of painting.

**I made these MyPaint-Brushes for GIMP**.

**This brushes is not suitable for MyPaint**, such as “002 Frame Line” in MyPaint will “pen leaking” phenomenon.
<br />In GIMP 2.10, hold down the Shift key “002 Frame Line” can draw a straight line.

Other brushes have also been debugged, such as “005 Calligraph” is a hard edge.
<br />“006 Paint Brush” to draw at maximum pressure, the edges will not jagged.

**MyPaint doesn't need these brushes**, it is just designed for GIMP 2.10.
<br />And I accidentally deleted MyPaint-brushes “.conf” file when debugging…
